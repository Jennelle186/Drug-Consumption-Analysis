## Illegal Drug Consumption Analysis

### Overview
Analyzed a large-scale survey dataset (2,000+ responses) to identify patterns and predictors of illegal drug consumption using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

### What I Did
- Cleaned, processed, and validated psychometric and demographic data for reliable modeling results  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on behavioral and socio-demographic variables  
- Developed machine learning models to estimate drug use and identify major risk factors  
- Created clear, decision-supporting data visualizations  

### Data Used
- Personality and behavioral assessments (NEO-FFI-R, BIS-11, ImpSS)  
- Demographic variables (age, gender, education, ethnicity, location)  

### Tools & Skills
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (machine learning)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook
